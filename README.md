# AddIntegers - .txtFiles
Learn how to add integers values of different .txt files without hard-code .txt files names

A production-ready function that sums the numbers in a file. The function receives the path to a file as input . Each line of the file contains either a number or a path to another file. For each file, output the file path and the sum of the numbers contained both directly in the file or in any of the sub files listed (or their sub files, etc).

For example, if file A.txt contains:
3
19
B.txt
50

And file B.txt contains:
C.txt
27

And file C.txt contains:
10
2

This is just an example. The solution is able to handle any set of files as described in the problem statement.
It doesn't need any GUI
